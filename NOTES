  + MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)
    IMPORTANT: before installing any ports, edit
    /opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/port1.0/portconfigure.tcl such that
    the line that begins with "default configure.ldflags" reads as:
      default configure.ldflags   {"-L${prefix}/lib -Xlinker -headerpad_max_install_names"}
    Also edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf uncommenting the line:
      build_arch  i386

    WARNING: Running `port selfupdate` will wipe out these settings.
    NOTE: Python version 2.7 is broken in MacPorts. Do not use it.
