sysdevel
--------

sysdevel is a Python package that assists software development in
three related areas: model development, data visualization, and
collaboration & distribution. This package facilitates multi-model
simulation development by implementing a generic Model-View-Controller
interface. The View portion of this interface handles data
visualization by unifying both web-based and desktop UI tools. For
package distribution, sysdevel extends the distutils package to handle
external libraries and application freezing.

All code in sysdevel is released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0
